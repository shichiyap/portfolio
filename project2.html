            <p>Welcome Reward redemption rates were low across membership merchants, indicating that new users were not aware of or redeeming their rewards effectively.

    </div>

    <p class="description">
        By mid-July, both data and merchant feedback revealed a recurring issue across StoreHub membership merchants: 
        <b>newly signed-up members were not redeeming their Welcome Rewards</b>. Despite merchants were successfully acquiring new sign-ups, 
        these users were not converting into early loyal customers, indicating <b>activation was collapsing at the very first touchpoint of the loyalty funnel</b>.

    </div>

    <p class="description">
        I reviewed the weekly redemption activity across several merchants to understand where the activation was breaking down.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        The weekly redemption data exposed the <b>inconsistency in actual Welcome Reward usage</b>. <b>Saterono</b>, who raised the initial complaint, showed <b>chronically low engagement</b> before 17 July
        (3-8 redemptions per week) despite having 2,476 registered members. 
    </p>

    <img src="assets/Redemptions.jpg" id="redemption">

    <p class="description">
        This pattern revealed a critical friction point: newly joined members were receiving the Welcome Reward, but the platform was not helping them <b>notice</b>, <b>access</b>, or <b>apply</b> it.

        <h2 class="problem__title">Problem Statement</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="description">
        Newly joined members were not redeeming their Welcome Reward because the platform (Beep Delivery) did not adequately surface, signal, or guide users towards using it during check-out.

    <div class="stakeholder_analysis">
        <h3>Design Goal</h3>
        <p class="description">
        This project focused on increasing the <b>visibility</b> and <b>discoverability of available rewards</b> within the check-out flow, 
        especially the Welcome Reward, at the exact moment users are deciding whether to complete their order.
        </p>    

        <h3>WHY This Matters?</h3>
        <p class="description">
        From the backstory insights, the core issue was not the reward itself, but the lack of timely, 
        in-context cues that guide users from awareness → usage.
        </p> 

        <p class="description">
        The essential user actions required for a successful redemption:
        </p>
        
        <img src="assets/Reward Ecosystem.svg" id="reward">

        <p class="description">
        Users were consistently missing the reward because the current experience required them to manually open the voucher section 
        without any hint that something valuable was waiting inside.  
        </p>

        <p class="description">
        This created <I>invisible friction</I> that suppressed both redemption rates and early-stage customer activation.  
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h3>Design Strategy</h3>
        <p class="description">
        We followed a minimal-change, high-impact strategy instead of redesigning the entire checkout flow to avoid unnecessary disruption to the existing check-out experience. 
        </p>  

        <p class="description" id="strategy">
        <b>1. Surface Rewards Contextually at the Moment of Purchase</b>
        </p>

        <p class="description" id="questionnaire-description">
        We introduced a subtle but high-visibility indicator that alerts users whenever they have an available:
        </p>

        <ul class="description-list" id="reward-types">
            <li>Welcome Reward</li>
            <li>Points Reward</li>
            <li>Birthday Reward</li>
            <li>or any applicable unique promotion</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="description" id="questionnaire-description">
        This ensures timely awareness without adding cognitive load or interrupting the flow. 
        </p>

        <p class="description" id="strategy">
        <b>2. Preserve Existing Check-Out Mechanics</b>
        </p>

        <p class="description" id="questionnaire-description">
        To minimise engineering lift and avoid disrupting merchant operations, the solution did not modify:
        </p>

        <ul class="description-list" id="reward-types">
            <li>reward logic</li>
            <li>promotion validation rules</li>
            <li>or the Beep Delivery check-out infrastructure</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="description" id="questionnaire-description">
        The approach enhances the user experience <i>without touching core systems</i>. 
        </p>

        <p class="description" id="strategy">
        <b>3. Encourage Exploration of Other Rewards</b>
        </p>

        <section class="two-col-section">

                <p class="description" id="questionnaire-description">
                    Beyond improving Welcome Reward redemptions, the indicator was intentionally designed to shape healthier 
                    reward behaviours:
                </p>

                <ul class="description-list" id="reward-types">
                    <li>Increase visits to the <i>Apply Promocode</i> page.</li>
                    <li>Surface additional rewards users may not be aware of</li>
                    <li>Establish early patterns of reward engagement</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This creates a long-term uplift in building customer loyalty and repeat activation, not just a one-time spike.
